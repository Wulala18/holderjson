        "ingredients": "2 bunches broccolini (about 12 ounces), 1 cup kimchi, drained and roughly chopped, plus 2 tablespoons brine, plus finely chopped kimchi for topping, 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil, 1 tablespoon packed brown sugar, 1 clove garlic, grated, 8 ounces thin dried Chinese egg noodles, 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds, 6 slices thick-cut bacon, chopped",
        "instructions": "Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the broccolini and cook until bright green and crisp-tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with tongs to a colander and run briefly under cool water. (Keep the pot of water boiling.) Meanwhile, stir the kimchi brine, sesame oil, brown sugar, garlic and red pepper flakes in a small bowl. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the vegetable oil and bacon and cook, stirring, until the bacon is crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the red onion and cook until browned and softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the kimchi and cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the noodles to the boiling water and cook until al dente, about 3 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the noodles to the skillet (reserve the cooking water); stir until the noodles are well coated in the bacon-onion mixture. Add the broccolini and kimchi sauce to the skillet and toss until combined, about 1 minute. (Add up to 1/2 cup of the reserved cooking water if the pasta is too dry.) Season with salt. Divide among plates; top with the toasted sesame seeds and finely chopped kimchi."

        "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Thinly slice each cube of butternut squash and toss in a small bowl with the olive oil. Thinly slice the onion and sage. Sprinkle a work surface with the cornmeal and use a rolling pin and/or your hands to stretch the dough into a 12-inch circle. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray and place the dough onto it. Crumble the gorgonzola and sprinkle it evenly all over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border for the crust. Scatter the squash and onion on top of the cheese. Sprinkle the sage on top. Bake until the cheese is melted, the squash is softened and the crust is almost browned, about 11 minutes.

        "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Spray 4 of the tortillas with cooking spray (or brush with olive oil). Lay the oiled tortillas on a large cutting board oiled-side down. Brush with the mustard and sprinkle with about half of the cheese. Top each evenly with a thin layer of ham, onions and some pepper, and then finish with the remaining cheese. Brush the apple butter evenly on the remaining tortillas. Place one apple-butter tortilla on top of a ham-and-cheese tortilla (filling sides in), and firmly press the tortillas together to make a quesadilla. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Lay a quesadilla oiled-side down in the pan and cook until golden brown and the cheese starts to melt, about 2 minutes. Spray the top of the quesadilla with cooking spray, turn and cook until the other side browns and the cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with the remaining quesadillas. Cut the quesadillas into 4 wedges and arrange on plates. Toss the apples with lemon and juice and cinnamon to taste. Serve with the apple slices."
